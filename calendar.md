## Office Hours Calendar

`In-person office hours` are in <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span>, while `virtual office hours` are in <span style="color:brown">**brown**</span>. You should come to these with questions about anything â€“ labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc. 

`Graduate project office hours` are in <span style="color:purple">**purple**</span>; we offer both in-person and virtual office hours (check the event description).

<!-- Click on each event to see which GSI and/or reader is running each office hour time.   -->

{: .note }
> Almost all office hours will be held in-person in Warren Hall 101B. A small, limited portion of office hours are listed as online, primarily to accommodate online/remote students. From our experience in previous semesters, **the office hour experience in-person is much better (and much, much faster) than online**.

To access `in-person office hours`, go to the room in the location of the office hour slot you're planning on attending.

To access `virtual office hours`, place your ticket on the [queue](http://oh.ds100.org/) and then join the call with the "Join Call" button when your name is pulled.

`Instructor office hours` with Prof. Gonzalez and Prof. Norouzi appear in <span style="color:red">**red**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts.
