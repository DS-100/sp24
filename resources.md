#### Calculus and Linear Algebra
**Note**: None of these resources are meant to be a substitute for the appropriate requirement / co-requisite (Math 54, etc.). If you have no familiarity whatsoever with either of these topics, these may not be adequate and we strongly recommend spending time covering the prerequisite material yourself. We will assume that you have prior knowledge of these requirements and that these resources are simply to refresh your memory of concepts that you have previously learned. Please reach out to staff if you have any questions or concerns about this.

**Calculus**:
In terms of calculus, you will need to know a few things, most of which are covered within the space of the first homework and lab. Specifically, you will need to know univariate calculus rules like: Taking derivatives of a univariate function (i.e. f(x), where x is the only variable); Derivative power rule; Knowing derivatives of mathematical functions like: sinx,cosx,logx,ex; Chain rule; Product rule (rarely); Derivatives of sums. We will expect some multivariate fluency like: Taking partial derivatives of a multivariate function (i.e. f(x,y,z), where x,y,z are all variables); Gradients (the concept).

- Math 53: [Derivatives of Vector Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUrHFmPn-W4&ab_channel=PeterKoroteev)

**Linear Algebra**:

Concepts roughly in order of importance:
vectors, matrices; rank/nullity;
inner products, orthogonality, norms;
linear independence;
orthonormal matrices;
vector spaces;
projections;
invertibility.

## Books

Because data science is a relatively new and rapidly evolving discipline there is no single _ideal_ textbook for this subject.
Instead we plan to use reading from a collection of books all of which are free.
However, we have listed a few optional books that will provide additional context for those who are interested.

- **[Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/)**, the Data 100 textbook.

- **[Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)** (Free online PDF) This book is a great reference for the machine learning and some of the statistics material in the class

- **[Data Science from Scratch](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do)** ([Available as eBook for Berkeley students](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781491901410/?ar)) This more applied book covers many of the topics in this class using Python but doesn't go into sufficient depth for some of the more mathematical material.

- **[Doing Data Science](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do)**
  ([Available as eBook for Berkeley students](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/doing-data-science/9781449363871/?ar)) This books provides a unique case-study view of data science but uses R and not Python.

- **[Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)** ([Available as eBook for Berkeley students](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/?ar)). This book provides a good reference for the Pandas library.

## Wellness Resources

Your well-being matters, and we hope that Data 100 is *never* a barrier to taking care of your mental and physical health. Below are some campus resources that may be helpful.

Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP’s Specialists. The Program’s official website includes information on DSP staff, UCB’s disabilities policy, application procedures, campus access guides for most university buildings, and portals for students and faculty.

### For solving a dispute
{:.no_toc}
The [Ombudsperson for Students](https://sa.berkeley.edu/Ombuds) (Sproul Hall 250; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsperson can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students’ contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsperson, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm.

The [Student Advocate’s Office](https://advocate.berkeley.edu/) (SAO) is an executive, non-partisan office of the ASUC. We offer free, confidential casework services and resources to any student(s) navigating issues with the University, including academic, conduct, financial aid, and grievance concerns. All support is centered around students and aims for an equity-based approach.

### For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault
{:.no_toc}
The [Care Line](https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/) (510-643-2005) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting.

### For social services
{:.no_toc}
[Social Services](http://uhs.berkeley.edu/students/counseling/socialservices.shtml) provides confidential services and counseling to help students with managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. They specialize in helping students with pregnancy resources and referrals; alcohol/drug problems related to one’s own or a family member’s use; sexual assault/rape; relationship or other violence; and support for health concerns-new diagnoses or ongoing conditions. Social Services staff will assess a student’s immediate needs, work with the student to develop a plan to meet those needs, and facilitate arrangements with academic departments and advocate for the student with other campus offices and community agencies, as well as coordinate services within UHS.


### For finding community on campus
{:.no_toc}

The mission of the [Berkeley International Office](BIO, http://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/) (2299 Piedmont Avenue, 510-642-2818) is to provide support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university.

The [Gender Equity Resource Center](https://cejce.berkeley.edu/geneq), fondly referred to as GenEq, is a UC Berkeley campus community center committed to fostering an inclusive Cal experience for all. GenEq is the campus location where students, faculty, staff and Alumni connect for resources, services, education and leadership programs related to gender and sexuality. The programs and services of the Gender Equity Resource Center are focused into four key areas: women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); sexual and dating violence; and hate crimes and bias driven incidents. GenEq strives to provide a space for respectful dialogue about sexuality and gender; illuminate the interrelationship of sexism, homophobia and gender bias and violence; create a campus free of violence and hate; provide leadership opportunities; advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual, hate, dating and gender violence; foster a community of women and LGBT leaders; and be a portal to campus and community resources on LGBT, Women, and the many intersections of identity (e.g., race, class, ability, etc.).

The [Undocumented Students Program](https://undocu.berkeley.edu/) (119 Cesar Chavez Center; 642-7224) practices a holistic, multicultural and solution-focused approach that delivers individualized service for each student. The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship.

The [Multicultural Education Program](http://mep.berkeley.edu/) (MEP) is one of six initiatives funded by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to work towards institutional change and to create a positive campus climate for diversity. The MEP is a five-year initiative to establish a sustainable infrastructure for activities like educational consultation and diversity workshops for the campus that address both specific topics, and to cater to group needs across the campus.

### For basic needs (food, shelter, etc.)
{:.no_toc}
The [Basic Needs Center](https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/home) (lower level of MLK Student Union, Suite 72) provides support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university.

The [UC Berkeley Food Pantry](https://pantry.berkeley.edu/) (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.
