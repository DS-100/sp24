<p>Hello! I’m Nitya and I’m a third year majoring in Computer Science. In my free time, I love exploring new cuisines and trying out new restaurants so let me know if you have any recs! Data 100 was one of my favourite classes at Berkeley so I hope you all enjoy it too. Looking forward to meeting you all! :)</p>
