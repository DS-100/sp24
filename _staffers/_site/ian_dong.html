<p>Hi! My name is Ian, and I’m a third year majoring in computer science and data science. In my free time, I love to play basketball, tennis, binging Netflix shows, and enjoying time with friends and family. I’m always looking to explore any TV shows to binge so hit me up with any suggestions!</p>
