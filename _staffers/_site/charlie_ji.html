<p>Hi all! I’m Charlie, a junior studying Computer Science and Data Science from Shanghai, China. This is my fourth semester on the Data 100 course staff. I love making music, playing board games, exploring great food spots, and embarking on all kinds of outdoor adventures. Feel free to reach out to me about anything—super excited to meet you all!</p>
