Hello everyone! I'm a Computer Science and Data Science (Honors) double major. The impact of Data100 on my academic journey has been nothing short of transformative, and I'm truly excited to have the chance to connect with each of you. My goal? To make this experience as fantastic for you as it was for me. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all, would love to get to know you all- cheers!
