Hi! My name is Ayesha Mahfuz and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. Data 100 has been one of my favorite courses I have taken at Berkeley so far and I am really excited to be on course staff this semester. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the class or Berkeley in general, I am always open to chat!
