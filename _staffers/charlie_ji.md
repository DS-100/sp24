Hi all! I'm Charlie, a junior studying Computer Science and Data Science from Shanghai, China. This is my fourth semester on the Data 100 course staff. I love making music, playing board games, exploring great food spots, and embarking on all kinds of outdoor adventures. Feel free to reach out to me about anythingâ€”super excited to meet you all!
