However, your Datahub kernel can often only manage 2GB of memory at maximum. Given this limitation (and the size of most datasets), we recommend instead using Google Drive + Google Colaboratory. If you instead wish to work on the project locally, you can also download the files containing the datasets for each topic.</p> <h4 class="no_toc" id="how-to-pull-data-from-google-drive-directly-onto-datahub"><strong>How to Pull Data from Google Drive directly onto Datahub</strong></h4> <ol> <li><em>Get the Google Drive ID of the file</em>. To do this, first get the URL of the file. You can do this by right-clicking on the file in Google Drive and pressing ‘Share -&gt; Copy Link’. Once you have the URL, you can find the ID by looking for the set of characters after the /d/ in the URL. For example, in the following URL: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK/view?usp=sharing</code>, the Google Drive ID would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK</code>.</li> <li><em>Download the data</em>. Once you have the Google Drive ID of the file, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utils.py</code> file inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grad_proj</code> directory on your Datahub. This file has a number of useful functions for downloading data. You’ll want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch_and_cache_gdrive</code>. You will call the function in a notebook. The function takes in two arguments: <strong>(1) Google Drive ID</strong> that you got in the previous step, and <strong>(2) name of the file</strong>. Calling the function will generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> folder and place the file into that folder, using the name you came up with as the second argument of the function.</li> </ol> <p>Hopefully, the above steps help you to access the data on Google Drive. There are other ways to move the data onto Datahub. Consider looking into <a href="https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gdown</code></a> or just downloading the data from Google Drive and uploading it to Datahub manually.</p> <p>Take a look at the other functions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">utils.py</code> if you’d like to use other data sources to supplement your project.</p> <h3 id="topic-1-covid-19">Topic 1: COVID-19</h3> <h4 class="no_toc" id="dataset-a-testing-and-mortality-statistics">Dataset A: Testing and Mortality Statistics</h4> <p>This dataset contains US reports on COVID-19 testing and cases from the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University</a> and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

Please look at the <a href="#checkpoint-2-mandatory-check-in-75">rubric</a> for the checkpoint and what you need to include in the <a href="#final-project-report">Final Project Report</a> when determining what to include in your one-page document; the document should be a brief summary of all your progress so far. The staff member will quickly skim the document and give you guidance on the project as a whole. More details about submitting the one-page document and signing up for the staff member meeting will be announced on Ed soon.</p> <h2 id="final-project-report">Final Project Report</h2> <p>The project submission should include the following two components, as well as the YouTube video recording (more information to be announced later).</p> <h3 id="component-1-analysis-notebooks">[Component 1] Analysis Notebooks</h3> <p>This component includes all the Jupyter Notebook(s) containing all the analyses that you performed on the datasets to support your claims in your write-up. Make sure that all references to datasets are done as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/[path to data files]</code>. By running these notebooks, we should be able to replicate all the analysis/figures done in your write-up.</p> <p>Your analysis notebook(s) should address all of the following components in the data science lifecycle. Please note that a thorough explanation of your thought process and approach is <strong>as important as</strong> your work. Unreadable/uncommented code will lose points. Along with the code for the EDA portion (which also has to be included), we have provided a few additional preliminary questions/tips you can consider for the modelling portion of the project:</p> <ul> <li>What are the research questions that you are answering through your analysis? What type of machine learning problem are you investigating?</li> <li>Which model(s) do you use and why?</li> <li>How do you use your data for training and testing?</li> <li>Does your model require hyperparameter tuning? If so, how do you approach it?</li> <li>How do you engineer the features for your model? What are the rationales behind selecting these features?</li> <li>How do you perform cross-validation on your model?</li> <li>What loss metrics are you using to evaluate your model? Why?</li> <li>From a bias-variance tradeoff standpoint, how do you assess the performance of your model? How do you check if it is overfitting?</li> <li>How would you improve your model based on the outcome?</li> <li>Are there any further extensions to your model that would be worth exploring?</li> </ul> <h3 id="component-2-project-write-up">[Component 2] Project Write-Up</h3> <p>This is a single PDF that summarizes your workflow and what you have learned. It should be structured as a research paper and include a title, list of authors, abstract, introduction, description of data, methodology, summary of results, discussion, conclusion, and references. Make sure to number figures and tables, include informative captions and ensure you include the provenance of the figures in the main narrative. We encourage you to render the PDF using LaTeX, but we will not be able to provide assistance with LaTeX-related issues.</p> <p>Specifically, you should ensure you address the following in the narrative:</p> <ul> <li>Clearly state the research questions and why they are interesting and important.</li> <li>Introduction: ensure you include a brief survey of related work on the topic(s) of your analysis. Be sure to reference current approaches/research in the context of your project, as well as how your project differs from or complements existing research. You must cite all the references you discuss in this section.</li> <li>Description of data: ensure you outline the summary of the data and how the data was prepared for the modeling phase (summarizing your EDA work). If applicable, descriptions of additional datasets that you gathered to support your analysis may also be included.</li> <li>Methodology: carefully describe the methods/models you use and why they are appropriate for answering your research questions. You must include a detailed description of how modeling is done in your project, including inference or prediction methods used, feature engineering and regularization if applicable, and cross-validation or test data as appropriate for model selection and evaluation. <!-- You may also include interesting findings involving your datasets. --></li> <li>Summary of results: analyze your findings in relation to your research question(s). Include/reference visualizations and specific results. Discuss any interesting findings from your analysis. You are encouraged to compare the results using different inference or prediction methods (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, or classification and regression trees). Can you explain why some methods performed better than others?</li> <li>Discussion: evaluate your approach and discuss any limitations of the methods you used. Also, briefly describe any surprising discoveries and whether there are any interesting extensions to your analysis.</li> </ul> <p>The narrative PDF should include figures sparingly to support specific claims. It can include a few runnable code components, but it should not have large amounts of code. The length of the report should be 8 ± 2 pages when it is printed as a PDF, excluding figures and code.</p> <p>Tip: if you need to write a large amount of LaTeX on markdown, you may want to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%%latex</code> cell magic. However, we also encourage you to explore <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> for easily writing clean LaTeX documents.</p> <p>Please submit everything as a zip file to the final report submission portal on Gradescope.

This is graded on completion. ### External Peer Review Each group will peer review the projects from another group. The review will be graded by staff out of a total of 5 points. Each review should include the following components: 1. (1 point) A summary of the report. The summary should address at least the following: - What research question does the group propose? Why is it important? - How does the dataset relate to the research question? - What data modeling/inference techniques do the group primarily use to gain insights into their research question? Why are these techniques suitable for the task? - What are the next steps a researcher can take if they want to investigate the question further based off the work in the project? 2. (4 points, 2 per component) An evaluation of the report based on the Data Science Lifecycle. The review should include at least **one strong point and one suggestion for improvement** for each of the following components in the project: - Data collection and sampling - Data cleaning - Exploratory data analysis (data wrangling, visualization, etc.) - Data modeling (feature engineering, selection of the model, and evaluation of the model's performance, etc.) - Inference (do the results from the model sufficiently support the conclusion within the report?) The external peer review is also a great chance to learn from other people's work and reflect on the work of your own. ### Final Report: Analysis Notebook | Criterion | Points| |-------------------------------------------------------|-------| | Code readability and documentation | 5 | | Proper and sufficient utilization of Python libraries | 5 | | Overall code quality | 3 | | Replicability of the results | 7 | | **Total** | **20**| ### Final Report: Project Writeup | Criterion | Points| |------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------| | Introduction, motivation, and presentation of the research question(s) | 3 | | Exploratory data analysis | 5 | | Modeling and inference techniques | 7 | | Analysis of results | 7 | | Implementation of peer review feedback | 3 | | Discussion of potential societal impacts and/or ethical concerns | 2 | | Overall clarity and structure of the report | 3 | | **Total** | **30**| --> <h2 id="extra-resources-causal-inference">Extra Resources: Causal Inference</h2> <p>When studying the relationship between datasets, you might want to consult the following references on causality vs. correlation.
