    "content": "Please choose one of the following datasets to work on. You will be expected to complete all (2) tasks provided for your chosen dataset. Accessing Datasets . All of the provided datasets can be found in the Datahub directory shared/sp24_grad_project_data. You can access the data directly from Datahub. If you wish to work on the project locally, you can also download the files containing the datasets for each topic by right-click on the file in JupyterLab and select “Copy Download Link”. If you choose to train more complex models, DataHub might not have enough hardware resources or memory, in which case you can use Google Colab or your local machine. If you would like to use Google Colab, feel free to check out this link to get started. Topic 1: Computer Vision . In disaster situations, it is important for emergency response efforts to have access to quick and accurate information about an area in order to respond effectively. This project will explore how data science techniques can be useful for such efforts. Project Goals . | Learn to work with image data by learning to use common feature extraction techniques like Sobel edge filtering. | Learn to work on real-world data with common complexities such as class imbalance, low signal-to-noise ratio, and high dimensional data. | Learn how to design effective preprocessing and featurization pipelines for solving difficult machine learning tasks. | . Mission . You have been hired by a crisis response agency to help assist them with your impressive data science skills! The agency has found that using satellite imagery is highly useful for supplying information for their response efforts. Unfortunately, however, annotating these high-resolution images can be a slow process for analysts. Your mission is to help address this challenge by developing an automatic computer vision approach! . Dataset Description . The agency would like you to develop your approach on their internal dataset, derived from the xView2 Challenge Dataset. This dataset contains satellite images of buildings after various natural disasters. The buildings are labeled based on the level of damage sustained on a scale ranging from 0 (no damage) to 3 (destroyed). You can access all of the data within the ./satellite-image-data directory. The dataset consists of the following folders for different natural disasters . | midwest-flooding | socal-fire | hurricane-matthew | . Within each folder is a zip file train_images.npz containing the satellite images as numpy arrays and a train_labels.npy file with corresponding damage level labels. Testing: In the main directory, there are also the test_images_hurricane-matthew.npz and test_images_flooding-fire.npz zip files. The first contains test images from the hurricane-matthew disaster and the latter consists of a combination of test images from midwest-flooding and socal-fire. Getting Started . To help you with onboarding, the agency has provided a starter notebook starter.ipynb which will introduce you to the dataset and some useful internal tools. After completing the onboarding assignment you will be comfortable with the following: . | Loading and visualizing data using tools from data_utils.py | Processing different color channels in the dataset images. | Extracting feature information from images using tools from feature_utils.py. | . Exploratory Data Analysis . Now that you have successfully been onboarded, the agency would like you to start performing some exploratory data analysis to build an initial understanding of the data. As part of the exploratory data analysis, the agency is interested in understanding certain aspects of the dataset better. Specifically, they are looking for: . | Basic statistics about the dataset, such as the number of images per disaster type and the distribution of image sizes and damage labels. | Insights into useful image features for classifying images based on disaster type or damage level. Previous interns have found color information to be potentially useful. You are tasked with verifying this and exploring whether color features can effectively differentiate: . | midwest-flooding from socal-fire images. | Damage levels 1 and 3 within the hurricane-matthew dataset. | . | . Please prepare an EDA report to present to the agency leadership with the above in mind. Project Tasks . Now that leadership is pleased with your initial EDA report and confident in your data science ability, they would like you to assist the agency with various tasks. Please complete Task A first and then Task B. Task A: Disaster Type Classification . The agency consists of different subdivisions for assisting with different disaster types, e.g., fires, floods, etc. In the event of a disaster, the agency mounts its response effort by first assessing the type of disaster and then requesting the appropriate subdivision to assist with the disaster. Your task is to assist the agency with making this initial call quickly by automatically classifying images based on the disaster scenario. Specifically, your role will be to build a classifier that can distinguish images from the midwest-flooding disaster and the socal-fire disaster. To assess your performance, please submit predictions for the test_images_flooding-fire.npz images. This should be in a csv file test_images_flooding-fire_predictions.csv consisting of a single column with no header, with a 0 to indicate a midwest-flooding prediction and a 1 to indicate a socal-fire prediction. The prediction in row i should correspond to the ith image. Task B: Damage Level Classification . The agency needs to know how severe a disaster is in order to allocate resources for a response effectively. The agency is especially concerned with human lives and uses building damage as an important metric for disaster severity. Your task is to assist the agency by automatically detecting the building damage level after a disaster. Specifically, create a damage level classifier for the hurricane-matthew disaster. To assess your performance, please submit predictions for the test_images_hurricane-matthew.npz images. This should be in a CSV file test_images_hurricane-matthew_predictions.csv consisting of a single column with no header, with a 0-3 prediction of the damage level. The prediction in row i should correspond to the ith image. Resources . To assist you in your efforts the agency has compiled the following list of resources: . | For more background about the dataset you can look at the paper associated with the dataset. | For image processing, scikit-image is a very useful library. This tutorial may be helpful for learning how to use the library. | For problems with imbalanced classes, the imblearn library has useful tools and examples. | . Topic 2: Natural Language Processing . A common task in real-life data analysis involves working with text data. In this project, we will work with a dataset consisting of natural language questions asked by humans and answers provided by chatbots. Project Goals . | Prepare you to work with text data by learning common techniques like embedding generation, tokenization, and topic modeling. | Work with real-world data in its targetted domain. The data is non-trivial in both size and complexity. | Ask open-ended questions and answer them using data at hand. | . Dataset Description . The source dataset link is here. The author describes the dataset as follows: . This dataset contains 33K cleaned conversations with pairwise human preferences. It is collected from 13K unique IP addresses on the Chatbot Arena from April to June 2023. Each sample includes a question ID, two model names, their full conversation text in OpenAI API JSON format, the user vote, the anonymized user ID, the detected language tag, the OpenAI moderation API tag, the additional toxic tag, and the timestamp. Chatbot Arena is a platform where users can ask questions and two chatbots will provide answers. The user then votes on which chatbot provided the best answer. The dataset contains the questions, the answers, and the user votes. You can find the processed dataset in ./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz. The dataset is in JSON line format and compressed using gzip. It has gone through the following preprocessing steps to make analysis easier: . | Removed non-English conversations. | Removed conversations with more than one round. | Removed conversations classified as toxic or harmful. | . The dataset you will be working with contains 25322 rows (out of 33000 total rows) and 7 columns (example row). The columns are: . | question_id: A unique identifier for the question. | model_a: The name of the first chatbot model. | model_b: The name of the second chatbot model. | winner: The name of the chatbot model that won the user vote. | judge: The anonymized user ID that voted. | conversation_a: The conversation between the user and model_a. | conversation_b: The conversation between the user and model_b. | . There are two auxiliary datasets that you can use to help with your analysis: . | ./chatbot-arena-prompts-embeddings.npy contains the 256-dimensional text embeddings for each of the human questions. The embeddings are generated using OpenAI’s text-embedding model. We will explain what embeddings are and how you can use them later. | ./chatbot-arena-gpt3-scores.jsonl.gz (example row) contains labels for the dataset you can use for later modeling tasks. It has the following fields: . | question_id: The unique identifier for the question, as seen in ./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz. | prompt: The extracted human question. This is equivalent to the first message in conversation_a and conversation_b in ./chatbot-arena-conversations.jsonl.gz. | openai_scores_raw_choices_nested: The response from OpenAI GPT 3.5 model (see later for the prompt). It contains the evaluated topic model, the reason for a hardness score from 1 to 10, and the value. For each prompt, we have 3 responses from GPT 3.5 because it is a probablistic model. In fact, you will find in real world there are common multiple labels from different annotators for ground truth data. We extracted the fields into the columns below. | topic_modeling_1, topic_modeling_2, topic_modeling_3: The topic modeling for the first, second, and third response. Each topic should have two words. | score_reason_1, score_reason_2, score_reason_3: The reason for the hardness score for the first, second, and third response. | score_value_1, score_value_2, score_value_3: The hardness score for the first, second, and third response. | . | . We used this prompt to generate the responses. You are welcome to generate your own ground truth data. You can generate your own embeddings following this guide. Exploratory Data Analysis . For the EDA tasks, tell us more about the data. What do you see in the data? Come up with questions and answers about them. For example, what is the win rate of GPT4? What are the most common topics? Do different judges have different preferences? What are the most common topics? What are the most common reasons for a question being hard? . Project Tasks . Now, we aim to better understand the different chatbot models! Please complete both Task A and B. We have included example questions to consider, but you are expected to come up with your own questions to answer. For both tasks, you will be working with the data provided. But you are also expected to perform prediction on a holdout set. You can find the data in arena-validation-set-prompt-only.jsonl.gz in the same directory. The data contains fields question_id, prompt, model_a, and model_b. You are expected to predict the winner and the hardness score for tasks A and B respectively. You should submit your final prediction as a csv file with three columns question_id, winner, hardness_score. The winner column should be one of the four values: model_a, model_b, tie, or tie (bothbad). The hardness_score should be an integer from 1 to 10. Task A: Modeling the Winning Model . Given a prompt, can we predict which model’s response will win the user vote? You can start by analyzing the length, textual features, and embeddings of the prompt. You should also explore the difference in output of the different models. For modeling, you can use logistic regression or other modeling techniques to perform classification to predict the winner for the holdout set given prompt, model_a, and model_b. You should also evaluate the model using appropriate metrics. One hint would be to utilize topic modeling data by first clustering prompts given their embeddings, then for each cluster, train a model to predict the winner. Also, feel free to use the hardness score to help with the prediction. Task B: Hardness Prediction . While we provide the hardness score generated by GPT3.5, can you explore whether such scoring is useful and valid? For hardness score, we want it to be an integer value from 1 to 10. For example, if a prompt’s score is 1, we expect the weak model to be able to answer the question. If the score is 10, we expect the question to be hard, maybe only GPT4 can answer it. You can start by analyzing the embeddings and the topic modeling data. You can then use linear regression to predict the hardness score, using existing or new features. You should also evaluate the model using appropriate metrics. One challenging aspect here is that the output score should be integer value, while linear regression is used for continuous data. Getting Started . To get started, we provide a notebook nlp-chatbot-starter.ipynb that demonstrates how to load and inspect the data. Additionally, here are some example questions about the project that you are welcome to explore. Modeling: Perform some modeling tasks given our ground truth labels. Can you train a logistic regression model to predict the winner given embeddings? How about a K-means clustering model to cluster the questions? Can you use linear regression to predict the hardness score? We expect you to demonstrate how the well model works and how to evaluate them. You should justify the choice of model and the evaluation metrics. You should also discuss the limitations of the model and how to improve them. Analysis: By leveraging the question embeddings, can we find similar questions? How repeated are the questions in the dataset? Can you reproduce the Elo score rating for the chatbots and come up with a better ranking? How can we make sense of the data overall? . Resources . | Joey’s EDA and Elo rating modeling is a great resource to get started with the EDA. Note that (1) the plot is made with Plotly, we recommend you to reproduce the plot with Matplotlib or Seaborn, and (2) the Elo rating is a good modeling task to reproduce but we expect you to do more than just that (for example, demonstrate how Elo rating works and how to calculate it in your report). | An intuitive introduction to text embeddings is a good resource to understand what is text embeddings and how to use them. | Elo rating system and Bradley-Terry model are essential to model a ranking among the pairwise comparison. | Huggingface pipeline has many implementations of common NLP tasks for you to use, including sentiment analysis, summarization, text classification, etc. | spaCy is a wonderful library containing classifical NLP tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, etc. | .

[your studentIDs joined by _]/ data/[all datasets used] analysis/[analysis notebooks] narrative/[narrative PDF] figures/[figures included in the narrative PDF] . Please use student IDs joined by _ as the name for the top-level directory. The analysis notebooks must be runnable within this directory structure. If the narrative PDF includes any figures that are created in the analysis notebooks, the figures should be saved to figures/ by the analysis notebooks. [Component 3] Test Set Performance (10%) . This component of the final report will be graded based on your models’ performance on the test set for both tasks of your chosen project (please find the thresholds for each task in the rubrics). You will need to submit your predictions to Gradescope to get your test performance; you will be allowed to upload up to 4 times a day. Please find the test data for each task for both projects below. Topic 1 (CV) . test_images_flooding-fire.npz is the test for Task A and test_images_hurricane-matthew.npz is the test set for Task B; both files are located in shared/sp24_grad_project_data/satellite-image-data directory on Data 100 Datahub. Please submit two CSV files named test_images_flooding-fire_predictions.csv, and test_images_hurricane-matthew_predictions.csv to this Gradescope assignment. Each CSV should only contain one column named pred. Topic 2 (NLP) . Here are the test sets for both tasks - arena-validation-set-prompt-only.jsonl.gz, arena-validation-set-prompts-embeddings.npy, and arena-validation-set-topic-modeling.jsonl.gz; all files are located in shared/sp24_grad_project_data/nlp-arena-data directory on Data 100 Datahub. Submit a single CSV file with three columns named question_id, winner, hardness_score to this Gradescope assignment. [Component 4] Video Recording (10%) . Details will be released soon. ",

    "content": "This section includes a rubric for how different project deliverables are going to be graded. This section will be updated as we get further along the project timeline. Group formation + Research Proposal (5%) . | Short paragraph description of implementation plan and timeline (2%). | Forming teams by the deadline (3%). | . Checkpoint 1: EDA + Internal Peer Review (10%) . | Data Sampling and Collection (0.5%). | Data Cleaning (3%). | Exploratory Data Analysis (3%). | Figures (tables, plots, etc.) (3%). | Internal Peer Review (0.5%). | . Checkpoint 2: Mandatory Check-In (7.5%) . | Exploratory Data Analysis (1.5%). | Feature Engineering (2%). | Modelling Approaches (3%). | Preliminary Results (1%). | . Checkpoint 3: Project Report First Draft + Internal Peer Review (20%) . Please refer to the section on the Final Project Report for more information on how your first draft will roughly be graded. Your first draft will be graded more leniently than your final submission, but we’re still looking for largely the same elements. You do not need to submit the video and test set performance components for checkpoint 3, but you are expected to submit a comprehensive written report that summarizes your analysis. The internal peer review is a simple google form checking if each member of the group is contributing to the project and how the tasks are distributed among members. This is graded on completion. External Peer Review (7.5%) . Each student will peer review a project from another group; each student will be graded separately based on the feedback they provide in their review. The review will be graded by staff out of a total of 5 points. Each review should include the following components: . | (1.5%) A summary of the report. The summary should address at least the following: . | What is the conclusion drawn from the EDA and modeling results? | What data modeling/inference techniques do the group primarily use to gain insights into their research question? Why are these techniques suitable for the task? | What are the next steps a researcher can take if they want to improve their model further based off the work in the project? | . | (6%, 1% per component) An evaluation of the report based on the Data Science Lifecycle. The review should include at least one strong point and one suggestion for improvement for each of the following components in the project: . | Data collection and sampling | Data cleaning | Exploratory data analysis (data wrangling, visualization, etc.) | Data modeling (feature engineering, selection of the model, and evaluation of the model’s performance, etc.) | Inference (do the results from the model sufficiently support the conclusion within the report?) | Discussion (does the report effectively discuss the limitations of the methods used and the implications of the results?) | . | . The external peer review is also a great chance to learn from other people’s work and reflect on the work of your own. Final Project Report (50%) . | Analysis Notebooks (10%) | Project Writeup (20%) | Modeling Performance (10%) | Presentation Video (10%) | . Final Report: Analysis Notebook . | Criterion | Points | . | Code readability and documentation | 3 | . | Proper and sufficient utilization of Python libraries | 2 | . | Overall code quality | 2 | . | Replicability of the results | 3 | . | Total | 10 | . Final Report: Project Writeup . | Criterion | Points | . | Exploratory data analysis | 3 | . | Modeling and inference techniques | 6 | . | Analysis of results | 5 | . | Implementation of peer review feedback | 2 | . | Discussion of potential societal impacts and/or ethical concerns | 2 | . | Overall clarity and structure of the report | 2 | . | Total | 20 | . Final Report: Modeling Performance . For both projects, the maximum for each task is 5 points; please see the thresholds for the tasks below. Topic 1 (CV) . | Task (metric) | Threshold | Points | . | Task A (accuracy) | 0.8131 | 3 | . |   | 0.9003 | 4 | . |   | 0.9927 | 5 | . | Task B (F1 score) | 0.3987 | 3 | . |   | 0.4334 | 4 | . |   | 0.5602 | 5 | . Topic 2 (NLP) . | Task (metric) | Threshold | Points | . | Task A (accuracy) | 0.50 | 3 | . |   | 0.52 | 4 | . |   | 0.54 | 5 | . | Task B (MSE) | 2.78 | 3 | . |   | 2.64 | 4 | . |   | 2.5 | 5 | . ",

    "content": "Your well-being matters, and we hope that Data 100 is never a barrier to taking care of your mental and physical health. Below are some campus resources that may be helpful. COVID-19 Resources and Support . You can find UC Berkeley’ COVID-19 resources and support here. For academic performance, support, and technology . The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (325 Davis Hall) is an inclusive center that offers study spaces, nutritious snacks, and tutoring in &gt;50 courses for Berkeley engineers and other majors across campus. The Center also offers a wide range of professional development, leadership, and wellness programs, and loans iclickers, laptops, and professional attire for interviews. As the primary academic support service for undergraduates at UC Berkeley, the Student Learning Center (510-642-7332) assists students in transitioning to Cal, navigating the academic terrain, creating networks of resources, and achieving academic, personal, and professional goals. Through various services including tutoring, study groups, workshops, and courses, SLC supports undergraduate students in Biological and Physical Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Statistics, Study Strategies, and Writing. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP, Cesar Chavez Student Center 119; 510-642-7224) at Cal has provided first generation and low income college students with the guidance and resources necessary to succeed at the best public university in the world. EOP’s individualized academic counseling, support services, and extensive campus referral network help students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university while empowering them to achieve. Students can access device lending options through the Student Technology Equity Program STEP program. For mental well-being . The staff of the UHS Counseling and Psychological Services (Tang Center, 2222 Bancroft Way; 510-642-9494; for after-hours support, please call the 24/7 line at 855-817-5667) provides confidential, brief counseling and crisis intervention to students with personal, academic and career stress. Services are provided by a multicultural group of professional counselors including psychologists, social workers, and advanced level trainees. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for CAPS services, regardless of insurance coverage. To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in Bechtel Engineering Center 241 (check here for schedule). For disability accommodations . The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP, 260 César Chávez Student Center #4250; 510-642-0518) serves students with disabilities of all kinds, including mobility impairments, blind or low vision, deaf or hard of hearing; chronic illnesses (chronic pain, repetitive strain injuries, brain injuries, AIDS/HIV, cancer, etc.) psychological disabilities (bipolar disorder, severe anxiety or depression, etc.), Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Learning Disabilities. Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP’s Specialists. The Program’s official website includes information on DSP staff, UCB’s disabilities policy, application procedures, campus access guides for most university buildings, and portals for students and faculty. For solving a dispute . The Ombudsperson for Students (Sproul Hall 250; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsperson can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students’ contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsperson, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm. The Student Advocate’s Office (SAO) is an executive, non-partisan office of the ASUC. We offer free, confidential casework services and resources to any student(s) navigating issues with the University, including academic, conduct, financial aid, and grievance concerns. All support is centered around students and aims for an equity-based approach. For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault . The Care Line (510-643-2005) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting. For social services . Social Services provides confidential services and counseling to help students with managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. They specialize in helping students with pregnancy resources and referrals; alcohol/drug problems related to one’s own or a family member’s use; sexual assault/rape; relationship or other violence; and support for health concerns-new diagnoses or ongoing conditions. Social Services staff will assess a student’s immediate needs, work with the student to develop a plan to meet those needs, and facilitate arrangements with academic departments and advocate for the student with other campus offices and community agencies, as well as coordinate services within UHS. For finding community on campus . The mission of the Berkeley International Office (2299 Piedmont Avenue, 510-642-2818) is to provide support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university. The Gender Equity Resource Center, fondly referred to as GenEq, is a UC Berkeley campus community center committed to fostering an inclusive Cal experience for all. GenEq is the campus location where students, faculty, staff and Alumni connect for resources, services, education and leadership programs related to gender and sexuality. The programs and services of the Gender Equity Resource Center are focused into four key areas: women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); sexual and dating violence; and hate crimes and bias driven incidents. GenEq strives to provide a space for respectful dialogue about sexuality and gender; illuminate the interrelationship of sexism, homophobia and gender bias and violence; create a campus free of violence and hate; provide leadership opportunities; advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual, hate, dating and gender violence; foster a community of women and LGBT leaders; and be a portal to campus and community resources on LGBT, Women, and the many intersections of identity (e.g., race, class, ability, etc.). The Undocumented Students Program (119 Cesar Chavez Center; 642-7224) practices a holistic, multicultural and solution-focused approach that delivers individualized service for each student. The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship. The Multicultural Education Program (MEP) is one of six initiatives funded by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to work towards institutional change and to create a positive campus climate for diversity. The MEP is a five-year initiative to establish a sustainable infrastructure for activities like educational consultation and diversity workshops for the campus that address both specific topics, and to cater to group needs across the campus. For basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) . The Basic Needs Center (lower level of MLK Student Union, Suite 72) provides support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all. They define Basic Needs as the essential resources that impact your health, belonging, persistence, and overall well being. It is an ecosystem that includes: nutritious food, stable housing, hygiene, transportation, healthcare, mental wellness, financial sustainability, sleep, and emergency dependent services. They refuse to accept hunger, homelessness, and all other basic needs injustices as part of our university. The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

This is to prevent inconsistent behavior due to differences in package versions. | Using the Terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded data100_environment.yml. Run these commands to create a new conda environment. Each conda environment maintains its own package versions, allowing us to switch between package versions easily. For example, this class uses Python 3, but you might have another that uses Python 2. With a conda environment, you can switch between those at will. # sanity check on conda installation. Should be 4.5 or higher conda --version # update conda just in case it's out of date # enter y if prompted to proceed conda update conda # download git conda install -c anaconda git # Create a python 3.6 conda environment with the full set # of packages specified in environment.yml (jupyter, numpy, pandas, ...) conda env create -f data100_environment.yml # Switch to the data100 environment conda activate data100 # Check if packages are in the environment # This should not be empty! conda list . | . From now on, you can switch to the data100 env with conda activate data100, and switch back to the default env with conda deactivate. ",

    "content": "Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between Data 8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing. Goals . | Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context. | Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques. | Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems. | . Prerequisites . While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. Prerequisites will be enforced in Data 100. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites. The instructors do not have the authority to waive these requirements. Undergraduates should fill out the Enrollment Exception Form managed by CDSS to request an exception. | Foundations of Data Science: Data 8 covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data 8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning. | Computing: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS 61A) or Computational Structures in Data Science (Data 88C). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python. | Math: Linear Algebra (Math 54, EECS 16A, Math 56, Math 110, or Stat 89A). We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, projections, and optimization to analyze and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100. | . Please consult the Resources page for additional resources for reviewing prerequisite material. Textbook: There is no official textbook for Data 100 this semester; we will provide course notes that will be released with the respective lectures. ",

    "title": "Course Culture",
    "content": "Students taking Data C100 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and safe learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community — the instructors, students, and course staff — are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Some of the responsibility for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with you, the students. Be Aware of Your Actions . Sometimes, the little things add up to creating an unwelcoming culture to some students. For example, you and a friend may think you are sharing a private joke about other races, majors, genders, abilities, cultures, etc. but this can have adverse effects on classmates who overhear it. There is a great deal of research on something called “stereotype threat”: research finds that simply reminding someone that they belong to a particular culture or share a particular identity (on whatever dimension) can interfere with their course performance. Stereotype threat works both ways: you can assume that a student will struggle based on who they appear to be, or you can assume that a student is doing great based on who they appear to be. Both are potentially harmful. Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not visible. Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc.), or interests that aren’t common to most students in the course. Another aspect of professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put down colleagues for situations they cannot control. Bragging in open space that an assignment is easy or “crazy,” for example, can send subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues that you can’t see. Please take care, so we can create a class in which all students feel supported and respected. Be Respectful . Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that the course staff, department, and university do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the term harassment; sexual harassment is a specific form that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX. UC Berkeley’s Title IX website provides many resources for understanding the terms, procedures, and policies around harassment. Make sure you are aware enough of these issues to avoid crossing a line in your interactions with other students. For example, repeatedly asking another student out on a date after they have said no can cross this line. Your reaction to this topic might be to laugh it off, or to make or think snide remarks about “political correctness” or jokes about consent or other things. You might think people just need to grow a thicker skin or learn to take a joke. This isn’t your decision to make. Research shows the consequences (emotional as well as physical) on people who experience harassment. When your behavior forces another student to focus on something other than their education, you have crossed a line. You have no right to take someone else’s education away from them. Communicate Issues with Course Staff and/or the Department . We take all complaints about unprofessional or discriminatory behavior seriously. Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk to us about it. The instructors in particular welcome any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff. See below for how to best reach us. From the Data Science Department: Data Science Undergraduate Studies faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels respected, included, and supported. We recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. There are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. If you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. Consider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through this online form. As course staff, we are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, and more.) To help accomplish this: . | If your name and/or pronouns differ from those that appear in your official records, please let us know. | If you feel like your performance in the class is being affected by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you. | We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. | While the course staff understands that improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not enough to overcome systemic issues in academia such as racism, queerphobia, and other forms of discrimination and hatred, we also recognize the importance of DEI work. | The Data Science Department has some resources available at https://data.berkeley.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion. | There’s also a great set of resources available at https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances. | . | If there are other resources you think we should list here, let us know! | .

Lecture . There are 2 live lectures held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00am-12:30pm, hybrid: in-person in Wheeler 150 and broadcasted live on Zoom. All session recordings, slides, activities, and examples will be uploaded to the course website within 24 hours of the lecture. Lecture participation: While synchronous lecture attendance (in-person or through Zoom) is not mandatory, we expect you to “participate” in lecture by answering lecture poll questions in one of two ways: (1) synchronously during the lecture as poll questions are launched; or (2) asynchronously using a link provided after lecture. | Lecture participation is graded using poll responses on a 0/1 basis. | Synchronous Participation: complete at least one participation poll question during the live lecture timeslot (11:00am-12:30pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays). As long as you submit a response to at least one poll question in this timeframe, you will receive synchronous attendance credit. | Asynchronous Participation: complete all participation poll questions from the link provided on the course website within one week of the corresponding lecture. | In both cases, participation is graded on completion, not correctness. | . | If you submit all participation polls over the course of the semester (i.e., do not use any of the three automatic drops), you will receive +0.5% bonus points applied to your final overall grade in the class. | See the Policies section for lecture participation drops. | . Discussion . Live discussion sections are one hour long, and held on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. The goal of these TA-led sessions is to work through problems, hone your skills, and flesh out your understanding as part of a team. The problems that you solve and present as part of discussion are important in understanding course material. The lectures, assignments, and exams of this course are structured with the expectation that all students attend discussion. The content covered in these sections is designed to solidify understanding of key lecture concepts and prepare students for homework assignments. It is to your benefit to actively participate in all discussions. This semester, we are offering two different grading schemes - graded versus ungraded discussion attendance. Discussion sections will commence in the second week of class, and students will need to sign up for the first discussion (details will be released through Ed). Following the first discussion, students will be asked to choose between the two grading schemes, and these decisions will be final. Students who choose the Graded Discussion Attendance Option will be assigned a discussion attendance based on their availability. Please note that discussion attendance is not mandatory for students enrolled in Data 200 and Data 200S. | Graded Discussion Attendance Option: Discussion attendance will be recorded each week and account for 5% of the overall grade. Each weekly discussion will be graded on a 0/1 basis. You will only get credit for attending the discussion section that you are signed up for. | Online sections are reserved for students with specific needs (e.g., DSP, Data 200S, etc.); these can be requested through the Pre-Semester and Discussion Selection Form. | All students are automatically granted 3 discussion drops to use for illness, personal emergencies, or other extenuating circumstances. These drops are designed to account for unexpected events – you should not plan to use them. | . | Ungraded Discussion Attendance Option: Instead, the 5% discussion weight will be redistributed, with 2.5% added to both the midterm and final scores. | . Students are not permitted to switch between the two grading schemes once finalized. However, if you would like to attend discussion at a later point in the semester, please reach out to us privately via Ed or data100.instructors@berkeley.edu. Please refer to Grading Scheme for a comprehensive grade breakdown. Homework and Projects . Homeworks are week-long assignments that are designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. Projects are 2-week assignments (with a weekly checkpoint) that synthesize multiple topics. | All homeworks and projects must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. There may be separate coding and written Gradescope portals for the same assignment; please check that you are submitting the right part. | Homeworks and projects have both public (visible) and hidden autograder tests. The public tests are mainly sanity checks. For example, a sanity check might verify that the answer you entered is a number as expected, and not a word. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are completing the assignment. | The primary form of support students will have for homeworks and projects are office hours and Ed. | Homeworks and projects must be completed individually, without the usage of any unauthorized resources (CourseHero, ChatGPT, etc). See the Collaboration Policy for more details. | See the Policies section for the submission grace period. | . Lab . Labs are shorter, weekly programming assignments designed to give students familiarity with new ideas. They are meant to be completed prior to homework. | All lab assignments must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. | All lab autograder tests are public (visible). | We will not be having lab sections for Data 100/200 this semester. Rather, we’ll provide extensive lab support on Ed and accompanying video walkthroughs. | All labs are intended to take about an hour. | Lab submissions are mandatory for students enrolled in Data 100 and Data 200S. Lab submissions are not mandatory for students enrolled in Data 200. See the Policies section for the submission grace period. | . Exams . There will be two exams in this course: . | Midterm on Thursday, March 7 7-9 PM PST. | Final on Thursday, May 9 8-11 AM PST. | . All exams must be taken in-person. There will be no alternate exams offered. Graduate Final Project . All students enrolled in the graduate version of the course (CS C200A or Stat C200C, i.e. Data 200; Data 200S) will be graded according to the Graduate grading scheme, which includes a team-based Graduate Final Project distributed in the second half of the semester. More details to be in the coming weeks. ",

While we do not have homework and lab drops this semester, we will offer a grace period for homeworks/projects/labs, as well as an Extenuating Circumstances Form. See the next sections for more details. On-Time Submission . All assignments are due at 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the due date specified on the Home / Schedule page. The date and time of this deadline are firm. Submitting even a minute past is considered late. Submitting by this “on-time” deadline earns an extra-credit on-time bonus, a 3% perk. This is available for homeworks, projects, and labs. Grace Period . We recognize that life can be unexpected, and that you may face circumstances that prevent you from submitting your work by the posted deadline. In light of this, we offer a 1-day (24 hour) grace period for late submissions of homeworks, projects, and labs. Note that this grace period is designed to account for unexpected emergencies or technical difficulties (e.g. assignment submission errors) – you should not plan in advance to use it! . You can make a late submission after the on-time deadline and up to the end of the grace period. These late submissions are not penalized, but do not earn the 3% on-time bonus. You do not need to explicitly contact staff about late submissions; just submit directly to Gradescope within the listed grace period. Submissions are not accepted beyond the grace period. The grace period is strictly enforced. We recommend thinking of the grace period as a backup, in case something unexpected comes up when aiming for the on-time deadline. As a result, getting an extension beyond the grace period will generally not be granted, except in rare, extraordinary emergencies (see the Extenuating Circumstances section). The grace period is also intended to account for unexpected circumstances such as DataHub issues, so we will not be granting extensions if you fail to communicate any datahub issues before the grace period begins. All official communication will refer to the on-time deadline as the expected dates that you will submit assignments. Extenuating Circumstances . We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and have widely-varying experiences. If you encounter extenuating circumstances at any time in the semester, please do not hesitate to let us know. The sooner we are made aware, the more options we have available to us to help you. The Extenuating Circumstances Form is for any circumstances that cannot be resolved via the grace period policy above. Within two business days of filling out the form, a course staff will reach out to you and provide a space for conversation, as well as to arrange course/grading accommodations as necessary. For more information, please email data100.support@berkeley.edu. We recognize that at times, it can be difficult to manage your course performance — particularly in such a huge course, and particularly at Berkeley’s high standards. Sometimes emergencies just come up (personal health emergency, family emergency, etc.). Our Grace Period Policy combined with the Extenuating Circumstances Form is meant to lower the barrier to reaching out to us, as well as build your independence in managing your academic career long-term. So please do not hesitate to reach out. Note that extenuating circumstances do not extend to logistical oversight, such as Datahub/Gradescope tests not passing, submitting only one portion of the homework, forgetting to save your notebook before exporting, submitting to the wrong assignment portal, or not properly tagging pages on Gradescope. It is the student’s responsibility to identify and resolve these issues in advance of the on-time deadline. We will not grant accommodations for these cases; instead, please use the grace period to cushion these submission errors. DSP Accommodations . If you are registered with the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) you can expect to receive an email from us during the first week of classes. Otherwise, email our student support team at data100.support@berkeley.edu. DSP students who receive approved assignment accommodations will have the 1-day grace period added to the approved extension to the on-time deadline. Please note that any extension, plus the grace period combined, cannot exceed 7 days. DSP students can submit assignment extension accommodation requests via the Extenuating Circumstances Form. You are responsible for reasonable communication with course staff. If you make a request close to the deadline, we can not guarantee that you will receive a response before the deadline. Additionally, simply submitting a request does not guarantee you will receive an extension. Even if your work is incomplete, please submit before the deadline so you can receive credit for the work you did complete. Regrade Requests . Students will be allowed to submit regrade requests for the autograded and written portions of assignments in cases in which the rubric was incorrectly applied or the autograder scored their submission incorrectly. Regrades for the written portions of assignments will be handled through Gradescope, and autograder regrades via a Google Form. The deadline for regrade requests (autograded and written) is one week after the grades are released for the corresponding assignment. Always check that the autograder executes correctly! Gradescope will show you the output of the public tests, and you should see the same results as you did on DataHub. If you see a discrepancy, ensure that you have exported the assignment correctly and, if there is still an issue, post on Ed as soon as possible. Regrade requests will not be considered in cases in which: . | a student uploads the incorrect file to the autograder. | the autograder fails to execute and the student does not notify the course staff before the assignment deadline. | a student fails to save their notebook before exporting and uploads an old version to the autograder. | a situation arises in which the course staff cannot ensure that the student’s work was done before the assignment deadline. | . Collaboration Policy and Academic Honesty . We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, which states that using work or resources that are not your own or not permitted by the course may lead to disciplinary actions, including a failing grade in the course. Assignments. Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework and projects, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Restated, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem-solving, but you are not allowed to share your code nor answers with other students, nor are you allowed to post your assignment solutions publicly. Doing so is considered academic misconduct. We will be running advanced plagiarism detection programs on all assignments. Use of AI-assisted methods, such as ChatGPT, to generate written or code solutions to assignments is prohibited. Usage of past assignment solutions is also prohibited. Exams. Cheating on exams is a serious offense. We have methods of detecting cheating on exams – so don’t do it! Students caught cheating on any exam will fail the course. Plagiarism on any assignment, as well as other violations to Berkeley’s Code of Conduct, will be reported to the Center for Student Conduct. The CSC treats most first-time offenses as a Non-Reportable Warning. Additionally we reserve the right to give you a negative full score (-100%) or lower on the assignments in question, an F in the course, or even dismissal from the university. It’s just not worth it! . Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in Data 100! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and respect for you. Finally, know that it’s normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles, even though many try not to show it. Even if you don’t learn everything that’s being covered, you’ll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you’ll have nothing to build on. You aren’t expected to be perfect; it’s ok not to get an A. ",
