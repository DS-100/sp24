In general, if you’re drawing any conclusions regarding causality, please be sure to consult the extra resources on causal inference. Accessing Datasets . All the datasets provided by us can be found inside the following link on Google Drive: . Graduate Project Datasets Google Drive . If you wish to work on Datahub, we’ve provided some instructions on how to move the data from Google Drive onto Datahub. However, your Datahub kernel can often only manage 2GB of memory at maximum. Given this limitation (and the size of most datasets), we recommend instead using Google Drive + Google Colaboratory. If you instead wish to work on the project locally, you can also download the files containing the datasets for each topic. How to Pull Data from Google Drive directly onto Datahub . | Get the Google Drive ID of the file. To do this, first get the URL of the file. You can do this by right-clicking on the file in Google Drive and pressing ‘Share -&gt; Copy Link’. Once you have the URL, you can find the ID by looking for the set of characters after the /d/ in the URL. For example, in the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK/view?usp=sharing, the Google Drive ID would be 16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK. | Download the data. Once you have the Google Drive ID of the file, you can use the utils.py file inside the grad_proj directory on your Datahub. This file has a number of useful functions for downloading data. You’ll want to use fetch_and_cache_gdrive. You will call the function in a notebook. The function takes in two arguments: (1) Google Drive ID that you got in the previous step, and (2) name of the file. Calling the function will generate a data folder and place the file into that folder, using the name you came up with as the second argument of the function. | . Hopefully, the above steps help you to access the data on Google Drive. There are other ways to move the data onto Datahub. Consider looking into gdown or just downloading the data from Google Drive and uploading it to Datahub manually. Take a look at the other functions in utils.py if you’d like to use other data sources to supplement your project. Topic 1: COVID-19 . Dataset A: Testing and Mortality Statistics . This dataset contains US reports on COVID-19 testing and cases from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

(documentation) | cdc_death_counts_by_conditons.csv contains US weekly reports on health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving COVID-19. (documentation) | . You must choose to work with at least 2 of the reports above in your analysis. Topic 2: Climate and the Environment . Dataset A: General Measurements and Statistics . This dataset contains some general statistics and measurements of various aspects of the climate and the environment. You can access all the data within the Topic 2/Dataset A directory on Google Drive. It includes the following reports: . | daily_global_weather_2020.csv contains data on daily temperature and precipitation measurements. To learn how to use the data from this file, please read the following section on the first report. | us_greenhouse_gas_emissions_direct_emitter_facilities.csv and us_greenhouse_gas_emission_direct_emitter_gas_type.csv contain data reported by EPA (Environment Protection Agency) on greenhouse gas emissions, detailing the specific types of gas reported by facilities and general information about the facilities themselves. The dataset is made available through EPA’s GHGRP (Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program). | us_air_quality_measures.csv contains data from the EPA’s AQS (Air Quality System) that measures air quality on a county level from approximately 4000 monitoring stations around the country. (source) | aqi_data contains more data from the EPA from a number of sites across a multitude of different metrics. (source) | . The following subsection contains more details on how to work with the first report on global daily temperature and precipitation: . The first report on daily temperature and precipitation is measured by weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network for January to December 2020. The data in daily_global_weather_2020.csv is derived from the source file at https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/2020.csv.gz. To help you get started with a dataset of manageable size, we have preprocessed the GHCN dataset to include only the average temperature and precipitation measurements from stations that have both measurements. Each row in the preprocessed dataset contains both the average temperature and precipitation measurements for a given station on a given date. If you wish to explore the climate data for a different year, you can use the GHCN_data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to download and perform the preprocessing described above. Please be advised that depending on the dataset size for a given year, GHCN_data_preprocessing.ipynb may not run on DataHub. The data contains only the (latitude, longitude) coordinates for the weather stations. To map the coordinates to geographical locations, the reverse-geocoder package mentioned in the References section might be helpful. Dataset B: Biodiversity in the Ecosystem . This dataset contains studies focused specifically on the impact of environmental and climate changes on biodiversity and the local ecosystems. You can access all the data within the Topic 2/Dataset B directory on Google Drive.

Make sure that all references to datasets are done as data/[path to data files]. By running these notebooks, we should be able to replicate all the analysis/figures done in your write-up. Your analysis notebook(s) should address all of the following components in the data science lifecycle. Please note that a thorough explanation of your thought process and approach is as important as your work. Unreadable/uncommented code will lose points. Along with the code for the EDA portion (which also has to be included), we have provided a few additional preliminary questions/tips you can consider for the modelling portion of the project: . | What are the research questions that you are answering through your analysis? What type of machine learning problem are you investigating? | Which model(s) do you use and why? | How do you use your data for training and testing? | Does your model require hyperparameter tuning? If so, how do you approach it? | How do you engineer the features for your model? What are the rationales behind selecting these features? | How do you perform cross-validation on your model? | What loss metrics are you using to evaluate your model? Why? | From a bias-variance tradeoff standpoint, how do you assess the performance of your model? How do you check if it is overfitting? | How would you improve your model based on the outcome? | Are there any further extensions to your model that would be worth exploring? | . [Component 2] Project Write-Up . This is a single PDF that summarizes your workflow and what you have learned. It should be structured as a research paper and include a title, list of authors, abstract, introduction, description of data, methodology, summary of results, discussion, conclusion, and references. Make sure to number figures and tables, include informative captions and ensure you include the provenance of the figures in the main narrative. We encourage you to render the PDF using LaTeX, but we will not be able to provide assistance with LaTeX-related issues. Specifically, you should ensure you address the following in the narrative: . | Clearly state the research questions and why they are interesting and important. | Introduction: ensure you include a brief survey of related work on the topic(s) of your analysis. Be sure to reference current approaches/research in the context of your project, as well as how your project differs from or complements existing research. You must cite all the references you discuss in this section. | Description of data: ensure you outline the summary of the data and how the data was prepared for the modeling phase (summarizing your EDA work). If applicable, descriptions of additional datasets that you gathered to support your analysis may also be included. | Methodology: carefully describe the methods/models you use and why they are appropriate for answering your search questions. You must include a detailed description of how modeling is done in your project, including inference or prediction methods used, feature engineering and regularization if applicable, and cross-validation or test data as appropriate for model selection and evaluation. | Summary of results: analyze your findings in relation to your research question(s). Include/reference visualizations and specific results. Discuss any interesting findings from your analysis. You are encouraged to compare the results using different inference or prediction methods (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, or classification and regression trees). Can you explain why some methods performed better than others? | Discussion: evaluate your approach and discuss any limitations of the methods you used. Also, briefly describe any surprising discoveries and whether there are any interesting extensions to your analysis. | . The narrative PDF should include figures sparingly to support specific claims. It can include a few runnable code components, but it should not have large amounts of code. The length of the report should be 8 ± 2 pages when it is printed as a PDF, excluding figures and code. Tip: if you need to write a large amount of $\\LaTeX$ on markdown, you may want to use the %%latex cell magic. However, we also encourage you to explore Overleaf for easily writing clean LaTeX documents. Please submit everything as a zip file to the final report submission portal on Gradescope. Please make sure the folder in the zip file has the following structure: . [your studentIDs joined by _]/ data/[all datasets used] analysis/[analysis notebooks] narrative/[narrative PDF] figures/[figures included in the narrative PDF] . Please use student IDs joined by _ as the name for the top-level directory. The analysis notebooks must be runnable within this directory structure.

    "content": "This section contains the datasets we will provide to you to explore your research questions. | You must incorporate at least one of the provided datasets. | You are welcome to bring in additional datasets to complement the datasets provided here, but you must cite the sources and clearly describe the content of any additional data you use in the final report. | . In general, if you’re drawing any conclusions regarding causality, please be sure to consult the extra resources on causal inference. Accessing Datasets . All the datasets provided by us can be found inside the following link on Google Drive: . Graduate Project Datasets Google Drive . If you wish to work on Datahub, we’ve provided some instructions on how to move the data from Google Drive onto Datahub. However, your Datahub kernel can often only manage 2GB of memory at maximum. Given this limitation (and the size of most datasets), we recommend instead using Google Drive + Google Colaboratory. If you instead wish to work on the project locally, you can also download the files containing the datasets for each topic. How to Pull Data from Google Drive directly onto Datahub . | Get the Google Drive ID of the file. To do this, first get the URL of the file. You can do this by right-clicking on the file in Google Drive and pressing ‘Share -&gt; Copy Link’. Once you have the URL, you can find the ID by looking for the set of characters after the /d/ in the URL. For example, in the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK/view?usp=sharing, the Google Drive ID would be 16-4O_lJGioPC5G9il4vR_XrCgJ3J9_zK. | Download the data. Once you have the Google Drive ID of the file, you can use the utils.py file inside the grad_proj directory on your Datahub. This file has a number of useful functions for downloading data. You’ll want to use fetch_and_cache_gdrive. You will call the function in a notebook. The function takes in two arguments: (1) Google Drive ID that you got in the previous step, and (2) name of the file. Calling the function will generate a data folder and place the file into that folder, using the name you came up with as the second argument of the function. | . Hopefully, the above steps help you to access the data on Google Drive. There are other ways to move the data onto Datahub. Consider looking into gdown or just downloading the data from Google Drive and uploading it to Datahub manually. Take a look at the other functions in utils.py if you’d like to use other data sources to supplement your project. Topic 1: COVID-19 . Dataset A: Testing and Mortality Statistics . This dataset contains US reports on COVID-19 testing and cases from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). You can access all the data within the Topic 1/Dataset A directory on Google Drive: . | csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us.csv contains US daily reports (documentation) | cdc_death_counts_by_sex_age_state.csv contains US reports on deaths involving COVID-19, pneumonia, and influenza reported to NCHS by sex, age, group, and state. (documentation) | cdc_death_counts_by_conditons.csv contains US weekly reports on health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving COVID-19. (documentation) | . You must choose to work with at least 2 of the reports above in your analysis. Topic 2: Climate and the Environment . Dataset A: General Measurements and Statistics . This dataset contains some general statistics and measurements of various aspects of the climate and the environment. You can access all the data within the Topic 2/Dataset A directory on Google Drive. It includes the following reports: . | daily_global_weather_2020.csv contains data on daily temperature and precipitation measurements. To learn how to use the data from this file, please read the following section on the first report. | us_greenhouse_gas_emissions_direct_emitter_facilities.csv and us_greenhouse_gas_emission_direct_emitter_gas_type.csv contain data reported by EPA (Environment Protection Agency) on greenhouse gas emissions, detailing the specific types of gas reported by facilities and general information about the facilities themselves. The dataset is made available through EPA’s GHGRP (Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program). | us_air_quality_measures.csv contains data from the EPA’s AQS (Air Quality System) that measures air quality on a county level from approximately 4000 monitoring stations around the country. (source) | aqi_data contains more data from the EPA from a number of sites across a multitude of different metrics. (source) | . The following subsection contains more details on how to work with the first report on global daily temperature and precipitation: . The first report on daily temperature and precipitation is measured by weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network for January to December 2020. The data in daily_global_weather_2020.csv is derived from the source file at https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/2020.csv.gz. To help you get started with a dataset of manageable size, we have preprocessed the GHCN dataset to include only the average temperature and precipitation measurements from stations that have both measurements. Each row in the preprocessed dataset contains both the average temperature and precipitation measurements for a given station on a given date. If you wish to explore the climate data for a different year, you can use the GHCN_data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to download and perform the preprocessing described above. Please be advised that depending on the dataset size for a given year, GHCN_data_preprocessing.ipynb may not run on DataHub. The data contains only the (latitude, longitude) coordinates for the weather stations. To map the coordinates to geographical locations, the reverse-geocoder package mentioned in the References section might be helpful. Dataset B: Biodiversity in the Ecosystem . This dataset contains studies focused specifically on the impact of environmental and climate changes on biodiversity and the local ecosystems. You can access all the data within the Topic 2/Dataset B directory on Google Drive. It includes the following reports: . | bioCON_plant_diversity.csv contains data collected as part of an ecological experiment, BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen), that started in 1997 and focused on studying biodiversity within the plant species at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Preserve. (documentation) | plant_pollinator_diversity_set1.csv and plant_pollinator_diversity_set2.csv contain ecological data collected from a long-term observation study from 2011 to 2018 that focuses on plant-pollinator interaction and its impact on local biodiversity. (documentation) | national_parks_biodiversity_parks.csv and national_parks_biodiversity_species.csv contain data published by the National Park Service on animal and plant species identified in individual national parks. | .

This component includes all the Jupyter Notebook(s) containing all the analyses that you performed on the datasets to support your claims in your write-up. Make sure that all references to datasets are done as data/[path to data files]. By running these notebooks, we should be able to replicate all the analysis/figures done in your write-up. Your analysis notebook(s) should address all of the following components in the data science lifecycle. Please note that a thorough explanation of your thought process and approach is as important as your work. Unreadable/uncommented code will lose points. Along with the code for the EDA portion (which also has to be included), we have provided a few additional preliminary questions/tips you can consider for the modelling portion of the project: . | What are the research questions that you are answering through your analysis? What type of machine learning problem are you investigating? | Which model(s) do you use and why? | How do you use your data for training and testing? | Does your model require hyperparameter tuning? If so, how do you approach it? | How do you engineer the features for your model? What are the rationales behind selecting these features? | How do you perform cross-validation on your model? | What loss metrics are you using to evaluate your model? Why? | From a bias-variance tradeoff standpoint, how do you assess the performance of your model? How do you check if it is overfitting? | How would you improve your model based on the outcome? | Are there any further extensions to your model that would be worth exploring? | . [Component 2] Project Write-Up . This is a single PDF that summarizes your workflow and what you have learned. It should be structured as a research paper and include a title, list of authors, abstract, introduction, description of data, methodology, summary of results, discussion, conclusion, and references. Make sure to number figures and tables, include informative captions and ensure you include the provenance of the figures in the main narrative. We encourage you to render the PDF using LaTeX, but we will not be able to provide assistance with LaTeX-related issues. Specifically, you should ensure you address the following in the narrative: . | Clearly state the research questions and why they are interesting and important. | Introduction: ensure you include a brief survey of related work on the topic(s) of your analysis. Be sure to reference current approaches/research in the context of your project, as well as how your project differs from or complements existing research. You must cite all the references you discuss in this section. | Description of data: ensure you outline the summary of the data and how the data was prepared for the modeling phase (summarizing your EDA work). If applicable, descriptions of additional datasets that you gathered to support your analysis may also be included. | Methodology: carefully describe the methods/models you use and why they are appropriate for answering your research questions. You must include a detailed description of how modeling is done in your project, including inference or prediction methods used, feature engineering and regularization if applicable, and cross-validation or test data as appropriate for model selection and evaluation. | Summary of results: analyze your findings in relation to your research question(s). Include/reference visualizations and specific results. Discuss any interesting findings from your analysis. You are encouraged to compare the results using different inference or prediction methods (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, or classification and regression trees). Can you explain why some methods performed better than others? | Discussion: evaluate your approach and discuss any limitations of the methods you used. Also, briefly describe any surprising discoveries and whether there are any interesting extensions to your analysis. | . The narrative PDF should include figures sparingly to support specific claims. It can include a few runnable code components, but it should not have large amounts of code. The length of the report should be 8 ± 2 pages when it is printed as a PDF, excluding figures and code. Tip: if you need to write a large amount of LaTeX on markdown, you may want to use the %%latex cell magic. However, we also encourage you to explore Overleaf for easily writing clean LaTeX documents. Please submit everything as a zip file to the final report submission portal on Gradescope. Please make sure the folder in the zip file has the following structure: . [your studentIDs joined by _]/ data/[all datasets used] analysis/[analysis notebooks] narrative/[narrative PDF] figures/[figures included in the narrative PDF] . Please use student IDs joined by _ as the name for the top-level directory. The analysis notebooks must be runnable within this directory structure. If the narrative PDF includes any figures that are created in the analysis notebooks, the figures should be saved to figures/ by the analysis notebooks. ",

Calculus and Linear Algebra . Note: None of these resources are meant to be a substitute for the appropriate requirement / co-requisite (Math 54, etc.). If you have no familiarity whatsoever with either of these topics, these may not be adequate and we strongly recommend spending time covering the prerequisite material yourself. We will assume that you have prior knowledge of these requirements and that these resources are simply to refresh your memory of concepts that you have previously learned. Please reach out to staff if you have any questions or concerns about this. Calculus: In terms of calculus, you will need to know a few things, most of which are covered within the space of the first homework and lab. Specifically, you will need to know univariate calculus rules like: Taking derivatives of a univariate function (i.e. f(x), where x is the only variable); Derivative power rule; Knowing derivatives of mathematical functions like: sinx,cosx,logx,ex; Chain rule; Product rule (rarely); Derivatives of sums. We will expect some multivariate fluency like: Taking partial derivatives of a multivariate function (i.e. f(x,y,z), where x,y,z are all variables); Gradients (the concept). | Khan Academy: Derivatives, Definitions, and Basic Rules; Multivariable Derivatives . | Math 53: Derivatives of Vector Functions . | .

    "content": "Your well-being matters, and we hope that Data 100 is never a barrier to taking care of your mental and physical health. Below are some campus resources that may be helpful. COVID-19 Resources and Support . You can find UC Berkeley’ COVID-19 resources and support here. For academic performance, support, and technology . The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (325 Davis Hall) is an inclusive center that offers study spaces, nutritious snacks, and tutoring in &gt;50 courses for Berkeley engineers and other majors across campus. The Center also offers a wide range of professional development, leadership, and wellness programs, and loans iclickers, laptops, and professional attire for interviews. As the primary academic support service for undergraduates at UC Berkeley, the Student Learning Center (510-642-7332) assists students in transitioning to Cal, navigating the academic terrain, creating networks of resources, and achieving academic, personal, and professional goals. Through various services including tutoring, study groups, workshops, and courses, SLC supports undergraduate students in Biological and Physical Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Statistics, Study Strategies, and Writing. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP, Cesar Chavez Student Center 119; 510-642-7224) at Cal has provided first generation and low income college students with the guidance and resources necessary to succeed at the best public university in the world. EOP’s individualized academic counseling, support services, and extensive campus referral network help students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university while empowering them to achieve. Students can access device lending options through the Student Technology Equity Program STEP program. For mental well-being . The staff of the UHS Counseling and Psychological Services (Tang Center, 2222 Bancroft Way; 510-642-9494; for after-hours support, please call the 24/7 line at 855-817-5667) provides confidential, brief counseling and crisis intervention to students with personal, academic and career stress. Services are provided by a multicultural group of professional counselors including psychologists, social workers, and advanced level trainees. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for CAPS services, regardless of insurance coverage. To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in Bechtel Engineering Center 241 (check here for schedule). For disability accommodations . The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP, 260 César Chávez Student Center #4250; 510-642-0518) serves students with disabilities of all kinds, including mobility impairments, blind or low vision, deaf or hard of hearing; chronic illnesses (chronic pain, repetitive strain injuries, brain injuries, AIDS/HIV, cancer, etc.) psychological disabilities (bipolar disorder, severe anxiety or depression, etc.), Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Learning Disabilities. Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP’s Specialists. The Program’s official website includes information on DSP staff, UCB’s disabilities policy, application procedures, campus access guides for most university buildings, and portals for students and faculty. For solving a dispute . The Ombudsperson for Students (Sproul Hall 250; 510-642-5754) provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsperson can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students’ contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsperson, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm. The Student Advocate’s Office (SAO) is an executive, non-partisan office of the ASUC. We offer free, confidential casework services and resources to any student(s) navigating issues with the University, including academic, conduct, financial aid, and grievance concerns. All support is centered around students and aims for an equity-based approach. For recovery from sexual harassment or sexual assault . The Care Line (510-643-2005) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting. For social services . Social Services provides confidential services and counseling to help students with managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more. They specialize in helping students with pregnancy resources and referrals; alcohol/drug problems related to one’s own or a family member’s use; sexual assault/rape; relationship or other violence; and support for health concerns-new diagnoses or ongoing conditions. Social Services staff will assess a student’s immediate needs, work with the student to develop a plan to meet those needs, and facilitate arrangements with academic departments and advocate for the student with other campus offices and community agencies, as well as coordinate services within UHS. For finding community on campus .

The Gender Equity Resource Center, fondly referred to as GenEq, is a UC Berkeley campus community center committed to fostering an inclusive Cal experience for all. GenEq is the campus location where students, faculty, staff and Alumni connect for resources, services, education and leadership programs related to gender and sexuality. The programs and services of the Gender Equity Resource Center are focused into four key areas: women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); sexual and dating violence; and hate crimes and bias driven incidents. GenEq strives to provide a space for respectful dialogue about sexuality and gender; illuminate the interrelationship of sexism, homophobia and gender bias and violence; create a campus free of violence and hate; provide leadership opportunities; advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual, hate, dating and gender violence; foster a community of women and LGBT leaders; and be a portal to campus and community resources on LGBT, Women, and the many intersections of identity (e.g., race, class, ability, etc.). The Undocumented Students Program (119 Cesar Chavez Center; 642-7224) practices a holistic, multicultural and solution-focused approach that delivers individualized service for each student. The academic counseling, legal support, financial aid resources and extensive campus referral network provided by USP helps students develop the unique gifts and talents they each bring to the university, while empowering a sense of belonging. The program’s mission is to support the advancement of undocumented students within higher education and promote pathways for engaged scholarship. The Multicultural Education Program (MEP) is one of six initiatives funded by the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund to work towards institutional change and to create a positive campus climate for diversity. The MEP is a five-year initiative to establish a sustainable infrastructure for activities like educational consultation and diversity workshops for the campus that address both specific topics, and to cater to group needs across the campus. For basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) . The Basic Needs Center (lower level of MLK Student Union, Suite 72) provides support with all the essential resources needed to not only survive, but thrive here at UC Berkeley. Their mission is to support you and work together towards justice and belonging for all.

The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (#68 Martin Luther King Student Union) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements. The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.

    "title": "About Data 100",
    "content": "Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between Data 8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing. Goals . | Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context. | Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques. | Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems. | . Prerequisites . While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. Prerequisites will be enforced in Data 100. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites. The instructors do not have the authority to waive these requirements. Undergraduates should fill out the Enrollment Exception Form managed by CDSS to request an exception. | Foundations of Data Science: Data 8 covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data 8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning. | Computing: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS 61A) or Computational Structures in Data Science (Data 88C). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python. | Math: Linear Algebra (Math 54, EECS 16A, Math 56, Math 110, or Stat 89A). We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, projections, and optimization to analyze and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100. | . Please consult the Resources page for additional resources for reviewing prerequisite material. Textbook: There is no official textbook for Data 100 this semester; we will provide course notes that will be released with the respective lectures. ",

    "title": "Course Culture",
    "content": "Students taking Data C100 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and safe learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community — the instructors, students, and course staff — are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Some of the responsibility for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with you, the students. Be Aware of Your Actions . Sometimes, the little things add up to creating an unwelcoming culture to some students. For example, you and a friend may think you are sharing a private joke about other races, majors, genders, abilities, cultures, etc. but this can have adverse effects on classmates who overhear it. There is a great deal of research on something called “stereotype threat”: research finds that simply reminding someone that they belong to a particular culture or share a particular identity (on whatever dimension) can interfere with their course performance. Stereotype threat works both ways: you can assume that a student will struggle based on who they appear to be, or you can assume that a student is doing great based on who they appear to be. Both are potentially harmful. Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not visible. Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc.), or interests that aren’t common to most students in the course. Another aspect of professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put down colleagues for situations they cannot control. Bragging in open space that an assignment is easy or “crazy,” for example, can send subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues that you can’t see. Please take care, so we can create a class in which all students feel supported and respected. Be Respectful . Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that the course staff, department, and university do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the term harassment; sexual harassment is a specific form that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX. UC Berkeley’s Title IX website provides many resources for understanding the terms, procedures, and policies around harassment. Make sure you are aware enough of these issues to avoid crossing a line in your interactions with other students. For example, repeatedly asking another student out on a date after they have said no can cross this line. Your reaction to this topic might be to laugh it off, or to make or think snide remarks about “political correctness” or jokes about consent or other things. You might think people just need to grow a thicker skin or learn to take a joke. This isn’t your decision to make. Research shows the consequences (emotional as well as physical) on people who experience harassment. When your behavior forces another student to focus on something other than their education, you have crossed a line. You have no right to take someone else’s education away from them. Communicate Issues with Course Staff and/or the Department . We take all complaints about unprofessional or discriminatory behavior seriously. Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk to us about it. The instructors in particular welcome any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff. See below for how to best reach us. From the Data Science Department: Data Science Undergraduate Studies faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels respected, included, and supported. We recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. There are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. If you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. Consider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through this online form. As course staff, we are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences and respects your identities and backgrounds (including race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, and more.) To help accomplish this: . | If your name and/or pronouns differ from those that appear in your official records, please let us know. | If you feel like your performance in the class is being affected by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you. | We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. | While the course staff understands that improving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are not enough to overcome systemic issues in academia such as racism, queerphobia, and other forms of discrimination and hatred, we also recognize the importance of DEI work. | The Data Science Department has some resources available at https://data.berkeley.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion. | There’s also a great set of resources available at https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances. | . | If there are other resources you think we should list here, let us know! | .

Lecture . There are 2 live lectures held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00am-12:30pm, hybrid: in-person in Wheeler 150 and broadcasted live on Zoom. All session recordings, slides, activities, and examples will be uploaded to the course website within 24 hours of the lecture. Lecture participation: While synchronous lecture attendance (in-person or through Zoom) is not mandatory, we expect you to “participate” in lecture by answering lecture poll questions in one of two ways: (1) synchronously during the lecture as poll questions are launched; or (2) asynchronously using a link provided after lecture. | Lecture participation is graded using poll responses on a 0/1 basis. | Synchronous Participation: complete at least one participation poll question during the live lecture timeslot (11:00am-12:30pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays). As long as you submit a response to at least one poll question in this timeframe, you will receive synchronous attendance credit. | Asynchronous Participation: complete all participation poll questions from the link provided on the course website within one week of the corresponding lecture. | In both cases, participation is graded on completion, not correctness. | . | If you submit all participation polls over the course of the semester (i.e., do not use any of the three automatic drops), you will receive +0.5% bonus points applied to your final overall grade in the class. | See the Policies section for lecture participation drops. | . Discussion . Live discussion sections are one hour long, and held on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. The goal of these TA-led sessions is to work through problems, hone your skills, and flesh out your understanding as part of a team. The problems that you solve and present as part of discussion are important in understanding course material. The lectures, assignments, and exams of this course are structured with the expectation that all students attend discussion. The content covered in these sections is designed to solidify understanding of key lecture concepts and prepare students for homework assignments. It is to your benefit to actively participate in all discussions. This semester, we are offering two different grading schemes - graded versus ungraded discussion attendance. Discussion sections will commence in the second week of class, and students will need to sign up for the first discussion (details will be released through Ed). Following the first discussion, students will be asked to choose between the two grading schemes, and these decisions will be final. Students who choose the Graded Discussion Attendance Option will be assigned a discussion attendance based on their availability. Please note that discussion attendance is not mandatory for students enrolled in Data 200 and Data 200S. | Graded Discussion Attendance Option: Discussion attendance will be recorded each week and account for 5% of the overall grade. Each weekly discussion will be graded on a 0/1 basis. You will only get credit for attending the discussion section that you are signed up for. | Online sections are reserved for students with specific needs (e.g., DSP, Data 200S, etc.); these can be requested through the Pre-Semester and Discussion Selection Form. | All students are automatically granted 3 discussion drops to use for illness, personal emergencies, or other extenuating circumstances. These drops are designed to account for unexpected events – you should not plan to use them. | . | Ungraded Discussion Attendance Option: Instead, the 5% discussion weight will be redistributed, with 2.5% added to both the midterm and final scores. | . Students are not permitted to switch between the two grading schemes once finalized. However, if you would like to attend discussion at a later point in the semester, please reach out to us privately via Ed or data100.instructors@berkeley.edu. Please refer to Grading Scheme for a comprehensive grade breakdown. Homework and Projects . Homeworks are week-long assignments that are designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. Projects are 2-week assignments (with a weekly checkpoint) that synthesize multiple topics. | All homeworks and projects must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. There may be separate coding and written Gradescope portals for the same assignment; please check that you are submitting the right part. | Homeworks and projects have both public (visible) and hidden autograder tests. The public tests are mainly sanity checks. For example, a sanity check might verify that the answer you entered is a number as expected, and not a word. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are completing the assignment. | The primary form of support students will have for homeworks and projects are office hours and Ed. | Homeworks and projects must be completed individually, without the usage of any unauthorized resources (CourseHero, ChatGPT, etc). See the Collaboration Policy for more details. | See the Policies section for the submission grace period. | . Lab . Labs are shorter, weekly programming assignments designed to give students familiarity with new ideas. They are meant to be completed prior to homework. | All lab assignments must be submitted to Gradescope by their posted deadlines. | All lab autograder tests are public (visible). | We will not be having lab sections for Data 100/200 this semester. Rather, we’ll provide extensive lab support on Ed and accompanying video walkthroughs. | All labs are intended to take about an hour. | Lab submissions are mandatory for students enrolled in Data 100 and Data 200S. Lab submissions are not mandatory for students enrolled in Data 200. See the Policies section for the submission grace period. | . Exams . There will be two exams in this course: . | Midterm on Thursday, March 7 7-9 PM PST. | Final on Thursday, May 9 8-11 AM PST. | . All exams must be taken in-person. There will be no alternate exams offered. Graduate Final Project . All students enrolled in the graduate version of the course (CS C200A or Stat C200C, i.e. Data 200; Data 200S) will be graded according to the Graduate grading scheme, which includes a team-based Graduate Final Project distributed in the second half of the semester.

It is your responsibility to know if you are enrolled in Data 100 or Data 200 or Data 200S. While we do not have homework and lab drops this semester, we will offer a grace period for homeworks/projects/labs, as well as an Extenuating Circumstances Form. See the next sections for more details. On-Time Submission . All assignments are due at 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the due date specified on the Home / Schedule page. The date and time of this deadline are firm. Submitting even a minute past is considered late. Submitting by this “on-time” deadline earns an extra-credit on-time bonus, a 3% perk. This is available for homeworks, projects, and labs. Grace Period . We recognize that life can be unexpected, and that you may face circumstances that prevent you from submitting your work by the posted deadline. In light of this, we offer a 1-day (24 hour) grace period for late submissions of homeworks, projects, and labs. Note that this grace period is designed to account for unexpected emergencies or technical difficulties (e.g. assignment submission errors) – you should not plan in advance to use it! . You can make a late submission after the on-time deadline and up to the end of the grace period. These late submissions are not penalized, but do not earn the 3% on-time bonus. You do not need to explicitly contact staff about late submissions; just submit directly to Gradescope within the listed grace period. Submissions are not accepted beyond the grace period. The grace period is strictly enforced. We recommend thinking of the grace period as a backup, in case something unexpected comes up when aiming for the on-time deadline. As a result, getting an extension beyond the grace period will generally not be granted, except in rare, extraordinary emergencies (see the Extenuating Circumstances section). The grace period is also intended to account for unexpected circumstances such as DataHub issues, so we will not be granting extensions if you fail to communicate any datahub issues before the grace period begins. All official communication will refer to the on-time deadline as the expected dates that you will submit assignments. Extenuating Circumstances . We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and have widely-varying experiences. If you encounter extenuating circumstances at any time in the semester, please do not hesitate to let us know. The sooner we are made aware, the more options we have available to us to help you. The Extenuating Circumstances Form is for any circumstances that cannot be resolved via the grace period policy above. Within two business days of filling out the form, a course staff will reach out to you and provide a space for conversation, as well as to arrange course/grading accommodations as necessary. For more information, please email data100.support@berkeley.edu. We recognize that at times, it can be difficult to manage your course performance — particularly in such a huge course, and particularly at Berkeley’s high standards. Sometimes emergencies just come up (personal health emergency, family emergency, etc.). Our Grace Period Policy combined with the Extenuating Circumstances Form is meant to lower the barrier to reaching out to us, as well as build your independence in managing your academic career long-term. So please do not hesitate to reach out. Note that extenuating circumstances do not extend to logistical oversight, such as Datahub/Gradescope tests not passing, submitting only one portion of the homework, forgetting to save your notebook before exporting, submitting to the wrong assignment portal, or not properly tagging pages on Gradescope. It is the student’s responsibility to identify and resolve these issues in advance of the on-time deadline. We will not grant accommodations for these cases; instead, please use the grace period to cushion these submission errors. DSP Accommodations . If you are registered with the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) you can expect to receive an email from us during the first week of classes. Otherwise, email our student support team at data100.support@berkeley.edu. DSP students who receive approved assignment accommodations will have the 1-day grace period added to the approved extension to the on-time deadline. Please note that any extension, plus the grace period combined, cannot exceed 7 days. DSP students can submit assignment extension accommodation requests via the Extenuating Circumstances Form. You are responsible for reasonable communication with course staff. If you make a request close to the deadline, we can not guarantee that you will receive a response before the deadline. Additionally, simply submitting a request does not guarantee you will receive an extension. Even if your work is incomplete, please submit before the deadline so you can receive credit for the work you did complete. Regrade Requests . Students will be allowed to submit regrade requests for the autograded and written portions of assignments in cases in which the rubric was incorrectly applied or the autograder scored their submission incorrectly. Regrades for the written portions of assignments will be handled through Gradescope, and autograder regrades via a Google Form. The deadline for regrade requests (autograded and written) is one week after the grades are released for the corresponding assignment. Always check that the autograder executes correctly! Gradescope will show you the output of the public tests, and you should see the same results as you did on DataHub. If you see a discrepancy, ensure that you have exported the assignment correctly and, if there is still an issue, post on Ed as soon as possible. Regrade requests will not be considered in cases in which: . | a student uploads the incorrect file to the autograder. | the autograder fails to execute and the student does not notify the course staff before the assignment deadline. | a student fails to save their notebook before exporting and uploads an old version to the autograder. | a situation arises in which the course staff cannot ensure that the student’s work was done before the assignment deadline. | . Collaboration Policy and Academic Honesty . We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, which states that using work or resources that are not your own or not permitted by the course may lead to disciplinary actions, including a failing grade in the course. Assignments. Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework and projects, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Restated, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem-solving, but you are not allowed to share your code nor answers with other students, nor are you allowed to post your assignment solutions publicly. Doing so is considered academic misconduct. We will be running advanced plagiarism detection programs on all assignments. Use of AI-assisted methods, such as ChatGPT, to generate written or code solutions to assignments is prohibited. Usage of past assignment solutions is also prohibited. Exams. Cheating on exams is a serious offense. We have methods of detecting cheating on exams – so don’t do it! Students caught cheating on any exam will fail the course. Plagiarism on any assignment, as well as other violations to Berkeley’s Code of Conduct, will be reported to the Center for Student Conduct. The CSC treats most first-time offenses as a Non-Reportable Warning. Additionally we reserve the right to give you a negative full score (-100%) or lower on the assignments in question, an F in the course, or even dismissal from the university. It’s just not worth it! . Rather than copying someone else’s work, ask for help. You are not alone in Data 100! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and respect for you. Finally, know that it’s normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles, even though many try not to show it. Even if you don’t learn everything that’s being covered, you’ll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you’ll have nothing to build on. You aren’t expected to be perfect; it’s ok not to get an A. ",
